  intro:
  - On this day, April 13th, 1942, a cocoon stands empty.
  - Once inhabited by your worm-like predecessor, it has now been evacuated by you,
    Butter Fly XIV.
  - You come from a long lineage of butterflies, all determined to make it to the
    forbidden promised land.
  - Will you make it?
  - Past the birds, the branches, and the obstacles that lie ahead... can you be
    the butterfly who could?
  - Filled with bravery... or foolish optimism... you fly away.
  random:
  - "That wind... it feels like... freedom!\\nNo, no... that\u2019s just harmful
    chemicals."
  - "Are the birds getting bigger?\\nYou\u2019re sure they are... they\u2019ll overtake
    the humans, soon.\\nYes... quite soon."
  - "If you look down, you can see where you\u2019d die...\\nBut you won't.\\nNot
    yet."
  - "You are a butterfly shooting at crows with bullets...\\nI\u2019ll let you ruminate
    on that.\\nHow do you feel?"
  - Oh, Crow, feathered bro, very much so, a pile of... like... innards, y'know?\nYou
    killed a bird; you get the point.
  - You are a well-oiled machine.\nGirl-butterflies want you; Crows fear you.
  - "In the distance... it\u2019s a... a factory!\\nNot where you\u2019re going,
    hopefully..."
  - "You know, you\u2019ve come far.\\nYou were a worm only a few birds ago, but
    now?\\nYou\u2019re a butterfly.\\nYou see no god up here, but for yourself!"
  - "So, where do the bullets come from...?\\nYou do know, right?\\nWell, don\u2019t
    look at me! I have no clue..."
  - While they were out wriggling, you studied the wings.\nWhile they were out having
    pre-cocoonal adventures, you were learning to dodge.\nWhen they wasted their
    days in pursuit of food... you studied the BULLET.\nAnd now, when the world is
    coated in smog, and the people are swinging their nets, they dare to come to
    you for salvation?
  - "Why do these crows always want to eat you?\\nDon\u2019t they have literally
    anything better to do with their time?"
  - "You\u2019ll get there soon, young one... soon..."
  - One of those crows was just... standing there... MENACINGLY!
  - "Do you ever wonder what happened with the development of Shower 2: Electric
    Boogaloo?\\nOh, you wouldn\u2019t know what that is..."
  - "What if we could just... take your destination... and move it over here?\\nNo,
    no... then the journey would be lost, and isn\u2019t that all that matters?"
  - "I don\u2019t mean to get political, but... What's your problem with birds?\\nWhat,
    just because they\u2019re big, scary, and could eat you... it doesn\u2019t mean
    they will.\\nAnd you just gun them down? Just like that?\\nYou\u2019re probably
    doing it right now... You\u2019re an ornithophobe, you."
  - "You know what would break up the pace a little? Some i m a g i n a t i o n\\n\\nAlright,
    that\u2019s enough of that now.\\nWe don\u2019t want too much imagination.\\nThis
    is a serious game, after all.\\nAbout serious issues.\\nLike the American Dream,
    and Japan, and... look, this is meant to be show, not tell, so how about you...
    you... flutter off!"
  - "Do you ever feel like a butterfly, drifting through the wind, wanting to start
    again...?\\nWell, I would suppose that\u2019s an accurate description of you,
    actually."
  - "Have you gotten the secret butterfly achievement yet?\\nWhat? Of course, this
    game has achievements \u2013 what reputable game wouldn\u2019t?!"
  - "Did you know that you can use the arrow keys to move and space to shoot?\\nWell,
    come to think of it, you probably do, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to make sure.\\nI
    mean, I can\u2019t exactly see what you\u2019re doing right now.\\nIs it possible
    that like a monkey typing up Shakespeare, you have just managed to get this far
    into the game without pushing a single button?\\nWell, that would be quite some
    luck..."
  - Is this a pigeon?
  - "Do you ever wonder if the thing you\u2019re going toward is a lamp?\\nWhat?
    Butterflies aren\u2019t moths?\\nWell, of course, they are, aren\u2019t they?\\nWhat
    do you mean, me lumping you all together is very insectophobic?"
  - "We should talk more about the themes of this journey, like the American Dream.\\nYou\u2019re
    always moving, always dodging, and always attacking.\\nAlways trying to get somewhere
    that isn\u2019t here...\\nYou\u2019re a stand-in for the working class American,
    unable to cope with the failures of the system!\\nI guess mother nature is the
    system in this context?\\nIt still needs to be ironed out..."
  - Why butterflies suck:\n$0 annual income, CEO of nothing, flutter-flutter mentality,
    zero networking skills, under 6 feet tall...\nGo lift some weights, invest in
    the stock market, and then talk to me.
  - You know, there could be a better name for this journey of ours...\nUntitled
    Butter Fly?\nNo, no... disregard.
  - Hey... if you get sick...\nDo you have the butter flu? No? OK, sorry-
  - "So, is the Hungry Caterpillar accurate to real life?\\nWhat do you mean that\u2019s
    insensitive?"
  - "The crows die for your sins...\\nYou may never make it to your forbidden promised
    land...\\nAll this mangled mass of feathers and viscera...\\nI ask for the first
    time, or for a second...\\nHow do you feel?\\nHa! You should have seen the look
    on your face! This isn\u2019t a horror game, you doof."
  - Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit
    the...\nFLOOOOOOOOOOOOOR
  - "This has been quite a journey so far, hasn\u2019t it?\\nBirds... tree branches...
    gunfire. These things all go together."
  - "Do you know where you\u2019re going? The destination.\\nCan you imagine if it
    wasn\u2019t real? That would be such a copout..."
  - "What did you do before you were a butterfly?\\nI like to imagine that you had
    a nice cottage somewhere underneath a leaf or something.\\n\\nThat\u2019s not
    just a thing in the movies, is it?\\nBugs do that in real life too, don\u2019t
    they?"
  - "Oh! Be careful of that rain, will you?\\nIt\u2019s all about the journey, and
    the journey\u2019s over if you get absolutely destroyed by the spring showers."
  - Is it true that you can flip your wings to cause a typhoon across the earth?\nThere
    would be a lot of typhoons starting by now if that were the case...
  - "Hey, hey \u2013 what happens when a stress-eating crow is nervous?\\nThey get
    butterflies in their stomach!\\nOK, fair reaction."
  - Hey... do you know what you should say when you see a crow?\nYou should say "Oh
    no! I butter fly away."\nNo? No one appreciates puns anymore.
  - "If you had friends, you\u2019d be quite the... social butterfly!\\nI\u2019m
    quite proud of that one."
  - "Do you believe in reincarnation?\\nYou could\u2019ve been a human fighter pilot
    or something.\\nThere is a war going, after all..."
  - How can you be sure you came from a cocoon,\nrather than someone throwing a stick
    of butter out of a window,\nirresponsibly giving life and confusion to a new
    being?
  - "*Cough* *Cough* That smog is bad, huh?\\nDo butterflies have respirators?\\nNo,
    I guess they wouldn\u2019t..."
  - "Smell that factory air?\\nCars, tanks, guns... doesn't matter what they\u2019ve
    got to put in the air, does it?"
  - You know, I wonder, was it always like this?\nThe air? The trees? The water?\nWas
    it always so... contaminated? Do you remember the time before?
  - They say you used to be able to see miles of mountain range up there before all
    the smog.\nWeird, huh?
  - "You see that cloud? Trying to act all cool?\\nToo bad he\u2019s just smog, huh?
    Huh? Please laugh-"
  - "The smog is getting so bad in some places that they can\u2019t read their clocktowers
    anymore.\\nGuess you could say that... they\u2019re running out of time?"
  - "You know, they may develop nuclear energy to fix all this smog someday.\\nMe?
    I\u2019d say to never trust an atom.\\nThey make up literally everything!"
  - "The weather sure is smoky, huh?\\nGet it? Because of the smoke?\\nYeah, I can\u2019t
    breathe either..."
  - "The smog obscures your vision...\\nYou can\u2019t see... all is lost.\\nThe
    promised land becomes just a little more forbidden.\\nIt was all such a waste,
    wasn\u2019t it?\\nThe journey? Why did you ever leave...\\nWas it about glory?
    Was it about honor?\\nWas any of it worth where you are now?\\nHey. Don\u2019t
    look so down \u2013 I was joking.\\nThis isn\u2019t that kind of journey.\\nIt\u2019s
    just a bit of fun."
  - "Maybe this smog is a good thing \u2013 it adds atmosphere, don\u2019t you think?\\nOr...
    I guess it also destroys the atmosphere."
  - "I wonder, do your kind know of what\u2019s going on out there?"
  - "The Americans will be here to save us soon!\\nThat\u2019s just something people
    like to say in these times."
  - "Yeah, get them for what they did to London!\\nCrows have been a huge issue in
    London lately, as I\u2019m sure you know."
  - "What do you call a fascist fish?\\nAdolfin!\\nYou don\u2019t have any fish friends,
    do you?"
  - "What do you call a fascist bug?\\nBenito Mosquitollini!\\nI know you\u2019re
    an insect, but even you have to admit that that\u2019s a good one-"
  - "Do you hear the sirens?\\nThey\u2019re not for you, but take them as a sign
    that you should hurry..."
  - So much destruction everywhere...\nDo you even remember why?
  - "On your feet, soldier.\\nWe\u2019re not done until every last crow in your path
    is out of it."
  - Thank you for your service.
  - You ever wonder what it means to wake up from the American Dream?
  - Is there a butterfly equivalent of the American Dream?\nThe Insectoid Plot? Sounds
    about right...
  - '"Keep heading towards your goal.\nFind the end of this and cash in those butterfly
    war bonds...'
  - "Get a job, deadbeat.\\nKidding \u2013 pursue... whatever it is you\u2019re after."
  - Have you invested in your 401K?
  - "It\u2019s about drive, power, and the urge not to be devoured."
  - "Don\u2019t let your memes be dreams... A great philosopher said that."
  - "You want to go play sports ball and drink some fluids at the bar?\\nYeah, I
    don\u2019t understand what Death of a Salesman was about either..."
  - "What you\u2019re after... do you think it\u2019s worth all of this?\\n\"What
    am I saying? Of course it is \u2013 you want to see the numbers go up.\\nThen
    you\u2019ll be happy..."
  - "When are you going to find yourself a nice lady-butterfly to settle down with?\\nYou
    don\u2019t have as much time as you think..."
  - Do a barrel roll!
  - "You know that crow\u2019s probably going through a divorce...\\nOr at least
    it will be, forcibly, once you're done with it."
  - "There\u2019s a seven on your six."
  - "There\u2019s a bogey on your twelve."
  - "Houston, we have a problem!\\nOkay, maybe I\u2019m a couple decades early with
    that reference."
  - "Woah! Be careful, you don\u2019t want to crash!"
  - "You\u2019re pretty high up \u2013 how are you on motion sickness?"
  - How many Gs are you experiencing right now?
  - Do you even have a flying license?
  - There is no society, and I refuse to elaborate.
  - Whatever happened to the good old days?
  - You know, crows are smart creatures.\nMessing with you was a bad idea, though.
  - These feathery fools... worst bird archetype.
  - "Crows aren\u2019t very trustworthy.\\nEven the Romans knew that.\\nThey say
    crows look like that because they took \u2018liar, liar, pants on fire\u2019
    to a very literal level."
  - We should give some of these crows names.\nThat one can be Steven Crow Durr.
  - Bet that crow had a family.\nHe could be related to David Crow-nenberg.
  - What do you call a crow at happy hour? A crow-bar.
  - "Who was Zeus\u2019s father? Crow-nos."
  - Are we there yet?
  - What do you call a shiny bird? Crow-m.
  - "Woah! That crow could\u2019ve been the physicist who discovered caws and effect!"
  - Crow see. Crow destroy.\nCrow have bullets. You have bullets.\nSuch is the way
    of war...
  - Dang - that shot right there was just plane wrong!
  - If you were fighting chickens instead of crows, would they be cockpits?
  - "What\u2019s your favorite day of the week? Is it... Flyday?"
  - "With the amount of dead crows, it\u2019s looking like Flyday the 13th."
  - "Woah, woah! That poor crow! He could\u2019ve gone to cawllege!"
  - That crow could have been your wingman...
  - Are you a birderer?
  - So... do butterflies have jetfuel, or...?
  - Croh no!
  - Was that Wood-crow Wilson?\nWait no, that was World War 1...
  - Too bad this wasn't springy ninjas...\nWait, you wouldn't get that.
